                                    <h2>Steps to Choose the Right HR Consultancy in Calicut</h2>

                                    <h3>1. Check Their Experience and Track Record</h3>
                                    <p>

                                    <h4>2. Understand Their Range of Services</h4>
                                    <p>

                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        Avoid one-size-fits-all approaches. A good consultancy studies your company’s culture, goals, and pain points to deliver tailored HR solutions
                                    </p>

                                    <h4>5. Review Client Testimonials and Case Studies</h4>
                                    <p>
